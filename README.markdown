Kotaky Monthly parser
=====================

This small rails application performs two tasks:
1. parse a kotaku-monthly url using the HPricot library and stores the pages in a database.
2. converts the pages into a single PDF document using Prawn and Prawnto

Installation
------------
To keep the code to a minimum, the used prawnto plugin is not included. Install this manually after downloading the code.
